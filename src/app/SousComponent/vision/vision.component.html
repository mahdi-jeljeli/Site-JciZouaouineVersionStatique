        <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
        <h6>“To be the foremost global network of young leaders” :</h6>
        <p>
            Our vision at JCI is bold and inspiring. We envision a world where young leaders from diverse backgrounds
            and cultures come together to form a powerful global network. We aspire to be the foremost platform that
            nurtures, empowers, and connects these young leaders
            <span *ngIf="showMoreONQuiSommeNous">
                providing them with unparalleled opportunities for growth and impact. Being the foremost global network
                of young leaders means that we are not just an organization; we are a movement. We are a collective
                force of passionate individuals who believe in the power of youth to drive positive change. We aim to
                create a vibrant community where ideas are shared, dreams are realized, and aspirations are turned into
                tangible actions. In this global network, we celebrate our differences and embrace our common goal: to
                make a difference in the world. We transcend the boundaries of nations and cultures because we
                understand that the challenges we face are global in nature. By fostering unity and collaboration, we
                harness the collective strength of our members to address pressing issues and create sustainable
                solutions.
